              student at State University of Jakarta. I have a strong passion
              for tinkering with technology and exploring new advancements in
              the field. My interests include game development, IoT, and solving
              practical problems through technology. I love to learn new things,
              face challenges, taking risks, and improve myself.

                I've noticed a pattern in how I handle side projects. On one
                hand I sometimes struggle to actually finish them. Once the
                initial excitement wears off, I'll either get distracted by
                another new idea or even fall into full-on procrastination mode.
                Other times I swing the other way, I'll overengineer a project
                that I trap myself, endlessly tweaking tiny details instead of
                moving on.<br /><br />

                On the positive side, this usually comes from genuine curiosity
                and a drive to dive deep into a topic, which is valuable when
                learning new things. But I've also learned that projects don't
                have to be perfect to be valuable. Lately I've been trying with
                setting smaller goals and finishing with "good enough" version
                first before polishing it. This helps me actually create usable
                products while still room for improvements. It's a work in
                progress, but I see it as part of growing as a person to be
                someone that can ship ideas into reality.

              My goal is to work on games, either solo or as a part of a small,
              tight knit teams where freedom of expression comes first. I want
              to make games that are not only entertaining but also thought
              provoking. For me, video games aren't just products, they're a
              form of art, and I want to spend my career creating pieces that
              genuinely matter to people.
